One of the first a startuper has to do to get started is to build a basic version of their app/website/product to show investors. This MVP often needs to be done fast, without sacrificing quality.

After working on a few MVP's, we have picked up a few tricks that might help you get your product running quickly.

# Don't try to reinvent the wheel

One of the common pitfalls when building a new software product is to build it from scratch. We get it, your app/website is different than the others. That's why it's better.

Except it's not that different. Whether you're building a social network, a mobile app or something else, chances are similar products already exist. They might not be exactly the same (which is probably why you're building your own), but they do pretty much the same thing.

So why build your product entirely from scratch when others have already done most of the job for you? Look online: there are probably many solutions (open source or otherwise) that could help you save a lot of time.

Use those tools! You'll be faster and you can even use some of that free time to do other things:

* Work on the others sides of your projects (business, marketing, contentsâ€¦)
* Build more functionalities, make your product even better
* Improve the design, polish up the code
* Give back to the open-source community by sharing some of your code
* Help others learn by publishing what you discovered
* Rest (if you're an entrepreneur, you probably need some) and go be with your loved ones
